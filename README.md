# Lie-detection-and-removal-in-PRFQ
Psychological questionnaires have become particularly popular
in settings where assessing the presence of psychological disorders
in a timely and economic fashion is deemed more important than
obtaining a detailed description. Examples may be decisions to
force an individual to undergo Compulsory Medical Treatment or,
more generally, court cases.
This paper is based on the results of an experiment conducted on
a sample of 339 individuals, who were asked to answer the Parental
Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) twice: once truthfully, once lying. In this second case, they were asked to imagine
that they were trying to obtain custody of their children in family
court.
We first concern ourselves with the identification of an accurate
method for the classification of honest vs faked profiles. However,
the final aim of the paper is that of establishing if, and with what
level of accuracy, it is possible to develop a method for the reconstruction of the "true" underlying answer profile, from the "fake"
one.
